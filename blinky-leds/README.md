## Introduction

The "Blinky LEDs" project is a classic introductory project for embedded programming. It showcases how to control the state of one or more LEDs connected to a microcontroller's GPIO pins. By making LEDs blink in a pattern, you'll gain insights into the hardware setup and low-level programming required in embedded systems development.

This project provides a basic template for creating your own bare-metal projects and serves as a learning resource for those new to embedded programming.

## Hardware Requirements

- STM32F407G-DISC1
- USB Cable (Type A to Mini Type B)

## Software Requirements

- Development toolchain (e.g., Arm GNU Toolchain, VS Code, OpenOCD, GDB client etc.)

## Getting Started

To get started with the "Blinky LEDs" project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your development environment:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ioulungTsai/bare-metal-dev.git
